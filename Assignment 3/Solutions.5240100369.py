"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
string = "Programming"
reversed_string = string[::-1]  # Using string slicing
print(reversed_string)


"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a user’s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")
names = full_name.split()
initials = ""
for name in names:
   initials += name[0].upper() + "."
print(initials)


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
string = input("Enter a string: ")
processed_string = ''.join(c for c in string.lower() if c.isalnum())
if processed_string == processed_string[::-1]:
   print(f"{string} is a palindrome.")
else:
   print(f"{string} is not a palindrome.")


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
word_count = len(words)
print("The number of words in the sentence is:", word_count)


"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
original_string = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_string = original_string.replace("is", "was")
print(modified_string)
